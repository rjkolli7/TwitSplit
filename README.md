# TwitSplit
The product Tweeter allows users to post short messages limited to 50 characters each. Sometimes, users get excited and write messages longer than 50 characters. Instead of rejecting these messages, we would like to add a new feature that will split the message into parts and send multiple messages on the user's behalf, all of them meeting the 50 character requirement.
